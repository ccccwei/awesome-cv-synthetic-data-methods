# Contribution Guidelines

*[中文版本](CONTRIBUTING_CN.md)*

## The Pull Request Should Have a Useful Title
Pull requests titled like `Update Readme.md` are not informative enough.  
Please write a descriptive title that summarizes **what** you added or changed—and **why** it's useful.

## Guidelines
- Submit a separate pull request for each suggestion.
- Use **title case** (e.g., "Add New Synthetic Data Tool") according to AP Style guidelines.
- Use the following link format for additions: `[Name or Description](link)`
- Add new links at the bottom of the relevant category.
- **New categories or improvements** to the existing structure are welcome—feel free to propose better organization.
- Double-check spelling and grammar.
- Ensure your text editor removes trailing whitespace.
- The **PR title and commit message** should both be useful and clearly reflect the change.

## How to Contribute?
1. Fork the repository and clone it locally.
2. Create a new branch for your contribution.
3. Make your changes following the guidelines above.
4. Commit with a clear message.
5. Push the branch and open a Pull Request explaining your contribution.
